A barebones (Linux) terminal-based text chat program using the UDP protocol, featuring a simple ncurses powered user interface with nice features like showing who has been recently active or is currently typing.
The program must be started with either the 'server' or 'client' argument to start or join a chat room, respectively. It will then prompt the user for more information.
